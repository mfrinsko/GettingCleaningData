This repository is used to store files for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project, taken in January 2015.  This README file explains the various files contained in this repository, and information about the output generated for the project.

##Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Details
The goal of this project is to give students practice in obtaining a real-world data set, and performing various steps to create tidy data sets from the original data.  The data set used for this project is a set of files with wearable computing data made available through the University of California-Irvine's Machine Learning Repository.  

The required output for this project is as follows:

1. A README.md file to explain the contents of the repository, as well as how to use the other files in this repository to evaluate the project output.  **You are reading this file right now.**
2. A script that contains all of the commands to download and transform the data into 2 tidy data sets.  **This is the run_analysis.R file.**
3. A codebook that details the data sets, and transformations that occurred to manipulate the data to its final tidy data format.  **This is the CodeBook.md file.**

##Notes on the run_analysis.R file
More here on the script itself and what it does...

Note the format of the output file that has been uploaded to Coursera - I chose to use pipe (|) as the separator value to make it easier to read in a text editor.  The command to read this back into R is as follows...
